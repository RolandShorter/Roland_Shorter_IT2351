Executive Summary: This assignment was working with insert, update, and aggregate functions.

Querry Review:
  Querry 2 was a simple insert statement where I added my name, email address, and a password by creating a statement where I made the parameters and then shoose the information to fill in those parameters.
  Querry 4 I created a statement that changed all discounts of of 30% to 28% I just set 28% where 30% was.
  Querry 5 I created a statement and used the sum funtion to add all the values in the ship_amount column to get my total.
  Querry 6 My thought was to get the values from the products table with using the count and max funtion then i thought I would join the categories table to the product table for my other value I need to grab.
  Querry 7 I did not get to since I was already having trouble getting the joins to work in Querry 6
