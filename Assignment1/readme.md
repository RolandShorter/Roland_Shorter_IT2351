 Executive Summary
 
  This assignment was to familarize myself with downloading MySQL and MySQL Workbench. Upon successful completion of intstalling MySQL and MySQL Workbench I learned how to work with MySQL Workbnech to connect to the server and Databases. I also learned how to use basic SQL statement to get data from the Databases.

 MySQL Workbench
 
  I downloaded the MacOs version of MySQL and the Workbench. It stared off a little difficult because my Mac didnt want to let me install the download for security reasons. So I went into securities and privvacy settings and overrode the setting to allow installation. After that it was a smoth installation.

 Queries
 
 I started strong with with first SQL staementwhere I downloaded the entire customer list. The second querry was a little more challenging only becaus I forgot to double click the database and I could figure out how to connect to the database. After numerous tries I read the information on querries and realized all I had to do was double click on the database. 

 Conclusion
 
  The assignment was really easy, I say that knowing that this will try my patience in the future and this is not a reflection of what is to come. My approach to future assignments is to find videos that will help me visualize how I should approach the problems and what it visually looks like. I understand the format just using the SQL staements in the wrokbench I know I need more work on.
