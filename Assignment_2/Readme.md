Executive Summary

This assingment was working on joining tables using different joins and unions.

Querry Review

The fist 2 problems seem to progress pretty easily. When I got tho the first join problem I found it challenging but got the expected outcome. From problem 5 through problem 8 I was completely lost. I thought that I was using the correct appoach with the differet joins, but I was unable to get any of the joins to even work. I know I should have been working on it earlier than I did but I foun the forst problems easy. i thought that if i followed the syntax for the other problems and used the one I felt best suited the problem I would be ok. AS you see it didnt work out. I definitley need help with the different joins if thereare videos that would help me understand how to use the joins that would be appreciated.

Conclussion

I need more work with the different joins and how to get them to work.
