Executive Summary:
  In thes assigmnet we were to use sub querries to write sql statements, and also use funtinons to work with strings.
Querry Review:
  In Queery 1 we used sub querries to join the product table and the category table to get information from the category table instead of a join . You have the category_id as a forgein key that allows you to do this .
  In querry 2 you use the avg funtion to get products that meet the criteria for the SQL scriot using the sub queery function instead of a join again.
Conclussion: I find subqurries easier to wrk with and understand than the Joins. I had trouble with the FORMAT and CHAR functions.
